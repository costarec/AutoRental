# AutoRental
AutoRental app example for TINFO-200 UW Tacoma SET - 2023wi  
- This example program is for TINFO-200 students at UW Tacoma 2023wi.
- The AutoRental program is an app designed to demonstrate object oriented programming using a simple POCO data object class and a test driver.
- The data object class (model) simply holds the details for the description of a Car object while the test driver in Program.cs has the job of executing all (or mostly all) of the code in the class.
- The sequence of this lesson in the course is to accompany the chapter 4 examples in the Deitel book **Visual C# How to Program, 6th Edition.**
- You should familiarize yourself with the 4 Account classes in chapter 4and note the change from the getters and setters to C# properties to auto-implemented properties to a combination.
- This example also shows the design of a data object class that also needs several construtors and an override of the ToString() method for formatted output of a Car object.
